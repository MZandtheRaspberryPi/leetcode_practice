## General Tips

### Strategies
Exemplify
* write out specific examples of the problem, see if you can find a general rule from that

Pattern Matching
* consider similar problems, and try to modify solution for a related problem to solve it

Simplify and Generalize
* Change constraint such as data type or amount of data, solve that
* generaliye problem, try to adopt earlier solution for more complex version

Base Case and Build
* solve for n = 1, then for n = 2 assuming you have n = 1.
* often lead to recursion

Data Structure Brainstorm
* Run through list of datastructures and apply each one
* Linked list (not well with sorting and acessing), array, binary tree, stack, heap?
