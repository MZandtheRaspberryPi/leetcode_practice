### Tips
* Read the Description Carefully to Understand the Goal
* Read description carefully to understand inputs (ie, array pointer, or full array)
* Check all of the example inputs against your code before submitting
* pay attention to constraints, they may tell you about edge cases
** 0 <= strs[i].length <= 200 means you could get an empty string, for instance
* don't change variable names after starting. risky. If you must, go through EVERY line to check for the old name.

### Syntax Errors
*forgot ";" in cpp
*forgot how to move in char array w/ pointers (--end) and how to access value (*end)
