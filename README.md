### Tips
* Read the Description Carefully to Understand the Goal
* Read description carefully to understand inputs (ie, array pointer, or full array)
* Check all of the example inputs against your code before submitting
* pay attention to constraints, they may tell you about edge cases (0 <= strs[i].length <= 200 means you could get an empty string, for instance)
* don't change variable names after starting. risky. If you must, go through EVERY line to check for the old name.

### Syntax Errors
* forgot ";" in cpp
* forgot how to move in char array w/ pointers (--end) and how to access value (*end)
* if using something from std library in c++ use std::, don't do using namespace std. but, don't forget std::.


### Interview Tips
* your filler is "uh". Cut it out. Take more breaths and thought time.
* don't need to talk 100% of time when solving
* think more
* be super careful when running examples. run every line in your head exactly. As missing a bug is unacceptable.
* Plan all code in design before start typing
* ask questions after about what company does. What they work on. Release process. Day to day. Ect.
* practice to self on zoom
